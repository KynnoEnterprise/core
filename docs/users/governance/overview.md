# Governance Overview

::: tip
**Note:** Working on a governance proposal? Make sure to look at the [best practices](./best_practices.md).
:::

Kynno has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing
text proposals, changing [chain parameters](./param_change.md), and spending [funds from the community pool](./community_pool.md).

## On- and off-chain Governance Structure

### Communication Methods

Governance practices and decisions are communicated through different types of documents and design artifacts:

- On-chain governance [proposals](https://www.kynno.org/proposals)
- Architecture Decision records
- Technical standards / specifications

### Decision-making and Discussion Venues

Venues involve community members to different degrees and individuals often perform multiple roles in the Cosmos ecosystem (validators, users, developers and core-members of Kynno Team). Because technical direction setting and development is almost always happening in the open, involvement from members in the extended community occurs organically.
